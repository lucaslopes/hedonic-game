# Legend
- ¹Initial Configuration
  - Modes Configurations:
    - Random (r): Nodes will be randomly selected to start inside cluster
    - Select (s): Chose which nodes will start inside cluster
    - Any other:  Start with an empty cluster
  - Modes Parameters:
    - Random (r): Number of nodes - If it is between 0 and 1 will be multiply by the number of nodes
    - Select (s): List of selected nodes. e.g. [node indice, ..., node indice]
- ²Potential Gain in %
  - Accumulated Gain / Initial Potential * 100
